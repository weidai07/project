        <p>I graduated from the University of Kansas in 2012. I previously worked as a Tax Accountant at the United States Department of the Treasury. Recently, I decided to step outside of my comfort zone and persue a new career path, and I have decided to point the direction of that career path in coding.</p>

        <p>Being in the IT field has always been an interest of mine, however, I have not had the oppertunity to persue it until now. Other interests of mine include being outdoors, meeting new people, making new friends, traveling, etc.</p>
